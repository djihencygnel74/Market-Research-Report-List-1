<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vehicle Supercharger Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Roots Supercharger</li><li>Twin-Screw Supercharger</li><li>Centrifugal Supercharger</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vehicle supercharger market comprises three main types: Roots supercharger, twin-screw supercharger, and centrifugal supercharger. Roots superchargers utilize two rotors to compress air, providing instant power but less efficiency at high RPMs. Twin-screw superchargers combine efficiency and power, compressing air through interleaved rotors, suitable for high-performance engines. Centrifugal superchargers use a rotating impeller to increase air pressure, offering efficient performance at high RPMs but slower response at low speeds. Each type serves distinct performance needs in the automotive industry.</p></p>
