<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Rotary Encoders for Robots Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absolute</li><li>Incremental</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Rotary encoders are crucial components in robotic systems for position feedback and motion control. The market is mainly divided into two types: absolute and incremental encoders. Absolute encoders provide a unique position value for every angle of rotation, ensuring precise positioning without needing a reference point. In contrast, incremental encoders measure changes in position from a known starting point, which can lead to errors if power is lost. Both types serve different applications based on accuracy and operational requirements.</p></p>
